Analyzing intermediate and high density gas kinematics in the Taurus Molecular Cloud and then attempting to build a model to replicate results. The code being added to this repository is part of my final project for my Introduction to Computing (ASTR 501) course and my Computation and Statistical Methods (ASTR 513) course at the University of Arizona. This project is also a part of my research towards my M.S. and Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Arizona. 

## Context
In Section F of the 2020 Astronomy Decadal Survey, which gave an update on the Interstellar Medium and Star and Planet formation, some of the main questions that were highlighted revolved around the drivers of the velocity structures seen in molecular clouds, how the roles that high-density structures play in the star formation process in larger molecular clouds, and how gas flows from parsec scales down to protostars and protoplanetary disks. These are some of the questions that this research aims to answer. 

### How it's done
Back in 2015, Yancy Shirley and Young Min Seo used the Green Bank Telescope to map the Taurus Molecular Cloud (L1495-B218) using the Ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions. These are strong tracers of intermediate and high density gas. Both have an abundance of hyperfine transitions (18 and 24 respectively), which are grouped into 5 and 7 groups respectively. Using Brian Svoboda's nestfit package, which uses Bayesian statistics and MCMC processes, we get posterior distributions of the velocities of the gas, the column densities, velocity dispersion, and a variety of other parameters. This package looks at the evidence to break the spectra into either 0, 1, or 2, velocity components, which can be broken up and analyzed in isolation from the other components that are cospatial along the line of sight.
