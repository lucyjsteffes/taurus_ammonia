# taurus_ammonia
Analyzing intermediate and high density gas kinematics in the Taurus Molecular Cloud and then attempting to build a model to replicate results. The code being added to this repository is part of my final project for my Introduction to Computing (ASTR 501) course and my Computation and Statistical Methods (ASTR 513) course at the University of Arizona. This project is also a part of my research towards my M.S. and Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Arizona.
